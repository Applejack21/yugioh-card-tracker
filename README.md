## Yu-Gi-Oh Card Tracker

A project I'm working on that would allow users to track which Yu-Gi-Oh cards they have collected within their collection.
This would utilise the [YGOPRODeck's API](https://ygoprodeck.com/api-guide/) to get card data. Users would then be able to mark which ones they have and which quantity of said card they have.
